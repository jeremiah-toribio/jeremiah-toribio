### Thanks for stopping by 👋
Currently a **data science student** at **Codeup**

What really fascinates me about data science is there is it has a near *limitless* application, it has a place anywhere.  

Hobbies: Jiu-jitsu 🥷🏼 , photography/ videography 📷 , Traveling 🗺️ 

> Highly motivated, *highly curious*
